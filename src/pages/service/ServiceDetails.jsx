              A consultant is a professional who provides expert advice and
              guidance to individuals or organizations in a particular field or
              industry. Consultants are typically hired to solve problems,
              improve performance, or provide specialized knowledge that the
              client lacks internally. Consultants can work independently or as
              part of consulting firms. They may specialize in various areas
              such as management, finance, technology, human resources,
              marketing, or specific industries like healthcare, IT, or
              manufacturing.
